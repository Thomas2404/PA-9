The project may not run because of issues with SFML files. This was an issue during development. 
You are probably aware of a solution to this problem, but I found that using a program called vcpkg
was very useful to resolve this issue. I have also included a separate file that contains the projects
.exe file, with all the needed .dll files and asset folder. This should run without any issues.

Thanks for grading our project and for teaching our class! We have all learned a lot from you.
